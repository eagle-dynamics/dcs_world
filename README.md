# Eagle Dynamics DCS World Prolog Pack

The r0y b0t construct comprises many interconnecting functional modules.
They split between open and core. Core are private and implement the DCS
multi-variant operating system supporting artificial intelligence; open
modules are public and reference static facts that world-specific
"gaming" strategies can use to reason by and manipulate a dynamic
multi-theatre world.
